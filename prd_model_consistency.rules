- **PRD-Model Alignment**

  - Every model MUST be verified against the PRD requirements before implementation
  - Field names in models MUST match field names in the PRD
  - Required fields in the PRD MUST be included in models
  - Relationships between models MUST reflect the data structure described in the PRD
  - Any deviation from the PRD MUST be documented with justification
  - When the PRD is updated, models MUST be reviewed and updated accordingly

- **PRD Verification Checklist**

  1. Identify all models mentioned in the PRD
  2. For each model, list all fields specified in the PRD
  3. Compare existing model implementations with PRD requirements
  4. Identify any missing fields or relationships
  5. Verify field types and constraints match PRD descriptions
  6. Document any intentional deviations with clear rationale

- **PRD Update Process**

  1. When PRD changes are made, review all affected models
  2. Update models to reflect new PRD requirements
  3. Update corresponding schemas to maintain consistency
  4. Generate migrations for model changes
  5. Test migrations to ensure they apply correctly
  6. Update documentation to reflect changes

- **Integration with DB Schema Consistency**

  - After verifying PRD alignment, follow DB Schema Consistency rules
  - Ensure models, schemas, and migrations remain in sync
  - Apply the schema update process as defined in DB Schema Consistency rules
  - Use the migration review checklist to prevent issues
  - Maintain documentation of model relationships and constraints

- **Model Implementation Workflow**

  1. Review PRD requirements for the model
  2. Create model class with fields matching PRD
  3. Implement relationships as specified in PRD
  4. Create corresponding schema with matching fields
  5. Generate and review migration
  6. Apply migration and verify database schema
  7. Document model in Memory Bank and update progress tracking
